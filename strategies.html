	<h3>Highest Interest Rate</h3>
	
	<p>
		By paying off the loans with the highest interest rate first you often end up paying less in interest in total.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This will <strong>often save the most money</strong>, but may be the <strong>most mentally and emotionally challenging</strong> to execute since 
		it often takes longer to feel like it is having any effect.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Lowest Interest Rate</h3>
	
	<p>
		This is calculated as a counter-point to the Highest Interest Rate strategy to show how much of a difference 
		the order makes.
